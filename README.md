# Sublime Text Snippets and More
Originally created for sharing Sublime Text snippets, this repository has grown to include additional resources.

## Dependencies
The `insert_date` package is used in these snippets for inserting dates. Install this package using Sublime Text's Package Control.
- [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/InsertDate)
- [Github](https://github.com/FichteFoll/InsertDate)

## Note
Sublime Text auto-generates the filename when you press `cmd+s/ctrl+s`. To facilitate this, the first line in most of the scripts here is the filename, making it easier to save.
